# Changelog

All notable changes in Yori are documented here

## [Unreleased] / En desarrollo
- (work in progress)
-tree shaking
-simple IR
[5.7.1]
1. Fixed bug were if api errors ocurred in `-series` mode it would interrupr file generation and skip them, ruining the project.

[5.7.0] 2026-02-10
1. Added `-series` mode: Generates multi-file projects sequentially to prevent AI context fatigue.
2. Enhanced `-make` mode: Automatically detects and executes build scripts (Makefile, CMake, etc.).
3. Improved `-run` behavior: In Architect Mode, it now executes the binary only after a successful build.
4. Fixed SECI Template Bug: Robust handling for mixed-line `$${...}$$` blocks.
5. Prompt Optimization: Reduced token usage and fixed error history accumulation.


[5.6.3]
1. added direct compilation. in case the input files are the same langauage and compiled, yori now calls the language compiler and
attempts to compile it directly so it saves tokens, it only sends the code to the llm if it finds errors

2. Full integration with Versa

[5.5] 2026-04-02
1. Added -make flag to yori
    It scans the yori text file looking for exports, it makes the directories and files indicated by the export keyword
2. implemented an Auto-Detection Build Trigger in yoric.cpp. Now, when running in -make mode with the -run flag, Yori will scan the output directory for standard build configurations (Makefile, CMakeLists.txt, scripts) and automatically execute the appropriate build commands.
    

[5.3] 2026-01-31 Don Bosco's day
1. added -3D command to support making of 3D files from gen.ai, currently supported files are
    -obj
    -stl
    -ply
    -gltf
    -svg
>yori inputfile.ext -o output.ext2 -computing_mode -3d "*instructions"

[5.2.5] 2026-01-30
1. Added see command to yori
    >yori config see 
    (prints the current configuration)

2. Changed the get-key logic to open the browser in freeapillm.com instead of google
3. added max retries command
    >yori config max-retries <value>
    (this configures the amount of iterations permitted for the healing loop)
[v5.1.0] 2026-01-23

1. Added sos command to ask model help based on a prompt 
    >yori sos [language] [-local | -cloud] "prompt"
[v4.9.1] 2026-01-22

### Added
1. Config menu command
2. selection menu for local models
3. users can now configure endpoint AI provider (i endorse OpenRouter)
4. users can change ai protocol between google and openai
5. google's and openai's endpoints are hardcoded since they are the most common, other endpoints must be entered manually
6. readded the -k flag, it is enabled by default on -u mode so executable and source are synchronized
7. Added "fix" command it works like this
    >yori fix "file.ext" "description of the wanted fixes" [-local | -cloud] 
    the command replaces the old file with a new version
8. Added explain commands   
    >yori explain <path> [-cloud | -local] [language]
In the language flag the user is meant to indicate which natural language (spanish, english, chineese, etc)
9. Added diff command
    >yori diff <pathA> <pathB> [-cloud | -local] [language]
It generates a markdown document explaining what changed between file versions, which entities changed, a summary of the changes in general, it generates the expaination in the indicated language


[v4.5.1] 2026-01-20

### Added
1. Fatal error handling, now error that are unfixable by the engine abort the whole operation.
2. Fatal error now prompts the user the option to analyze the error with the assistant
3. Pre-flight checks, now the system checks for dependency error before generating program tokens, saving computation resources
4. Cache logic is back and now supportsmultiple files

[v4.5] - 2026-01-20

### Added

1. Multi-file support: CLI now accepts multiple input files (e.g., yori main.cpp utils.py -o app.exe). 
2. Error Memory: The compiler now "remembers" previous compilation errors within the session to prevent AI from repeating mistakes.
3. Update Mode (-u): Re-implemented feature to update existing source code instead of generating from scratch.
4. Explicit Import Context: Preprocessor now wraps imported code with clear markers (// >>> START MODULE...) for better AI context.

### Improved
1. Safe Path Handling: Added automatic quoting to system calls to support file paths with spaces.
2. Configurable Toolchains: Build and version commands can now be overridden via config.json.
3. Contextual Prompting: Refined system prompts to better handle mixed-language inputs.

### Removed

1. Caching System: The .cache logic was temporarily removed to prioritize multi-file stability.
2. Ghost Binary Detection: Simplified the verification logic to reduce false positives.
