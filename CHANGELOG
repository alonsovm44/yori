All notable changes in Yori are documented here

## [Unreleased] / En desarrollo
- (work in progress)

[v4.9.1] 2026-01-22

### Added
1. Config menu command
2. selection menu for local models
3. users can now configure endpoint AI provider (i endorse OpenRouter)
4. users can change ai protocol between google and openai
5. google's and openai's endpoints are hardcoded since they are the most common, other endpoints must be entered manually
6. readded the -k flag, it is enabled by default on -u mode so executable and source are synchronized
7. Added "fix" command it works like this
    >yori fix "file.ext" "description of the wanted fixes" [-local | -cloud] 
    the command replaces the old file with a new version


[v4.5.1] 2026-01-20

### Added
1. Fatal error handling, now error that are unfixable by the engine abort the whole operation.
2. Fatal error now prompts the user the option to analyze the error with the assistant
3. Pre-flight checks, now the system checks for dependency error before generating program tokens, saving computation resources
4. Cache logic is back and now supports multiple files

[v4.5] - 2026-01-20

### Added

1. Multi-file support: CLI now accepts multiple input files (e.g., yori main.cpp utils.py -o app.exe). 
2. Error Memory: The compiler now "remembers" previous compilation errors within the session to prevent AI from repeating mistakes.
3. Update Mode (-u): Re-implemented feature to update existing source code instead of generating from scratch.
4. Explicit Import Context: Preprocessor now wraps imported code with clear markers (// >>> START MODULE...) for better AI context.

### Improved
1. Safe Path Handling: Added automatic quoting to system calls to support file paths with spaces.
2. Configurable Toolchains: Build and version commands can now be overridden via config.json.
3. Contextual Prompting: Refined system prompts to better handle mixed-language inputs.

### Removed

1. Caching System: The .cache logic was temporarily removed to prioritize multi-file stability.
2. Ghost Binary Detection: Simplified the verification logic to reduce false positives.
