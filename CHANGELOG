# Changelog

All notable changes in Yori are documented here

## [Unreleased] / En desarrollo
- (work in progress)

[v4.5] - 2026-01-20

### Added

1. Multi-file support: CLI now accepts multiple input files (e.g., yori main.cpp utils.py -o app.exe).
2. Error Memory: The compiler now "remembers" previous compilation errors within the session to prevent AI from repeating mistakes.
3. Update Mode (-u): Re-implemented feature to update existing source code instead of generating from scratch.
4. Explicit Import Context: Preprocessor now wraps imported code with clear markers (// >>> START MODULE...) for better AI context.

### Improved
1. Safe Path Handling: Added automatic quoting to system calls to support file paths with spaces.
2. Configurable Toolchains: Build and version commands can now be overridden via config.json.
3. Contextual Prompting: Refined system prompts to better handle mixed-language inputs.

### emoved

1. Caching System: The .cache logic was temporarily removed to prioritize multi-file stability.
2. Ghost Binary Detection: Simplified the verification logic to reduce false positives.
