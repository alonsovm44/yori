# Mission and Vision

## Mission
1. Democratize Software Creation: Make computational resources and high-performance software development accessible to everyone, regardless of their technical background or economic status. We believe the ability to create software should be a universal right, not a privilege of the few who can afford years of specialized education.
2. Bridge the Gap Between Thought and Machine: Eliminate the complexity of traditional programming syntax and toolchains. We aim to allow users to express their ideas using natural intent and high-level abstractions, while delivering the raw power and speed of native machine code.
3. Open Access for All: Maintain the Yori ecosystem completely free and open-source. We are committed to a "No-Gatekeeper" policy where technology is given freely to the community—developers, students, and researchers alike—ensuring that financial barriers never stifle innovation.

## Vision
**A world where language is the only code required**

We envision a future where the friction between human creativity and digital execution is reduced to zero. We see a software ecosystem where the complexity of memory management, linker scripts, and low-level optimization is fully abstracted by intelligent agents, allowing humanity to focus purely on solving problems.

In this future, a student in a rural village and an engineer in a tech hub have equal access to build world-class, high-performance applications. Yori is not just a tool, but a public utility for the digital age—a foundational layer that empowers the next generation of builders to construct the impossible without paying a toll. We strive to build a self-sustaining, community-driven platform where technology is a gift passed forward, freely given and freely received.
